# Key architectural decisions

The system follows a layered architecture pattern consisting of:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic and application rules
- **Repositories**: Manage data persistence and database operations

This separation of concerns provides:

- Improved code readability
- Better maintainability
- Easier testing through clear boundaries
- Simplified debugging flow

This project implemented **SOLID principles** throughout the codebase to ensure:

- Single responsibility for each component
- Open/closed architecture for extensibility
- Liskov substitution compatibility
- Interface segregation for clean contracts
- Dependency injection for loose coupling

The architecture enables:

- Straightforward onboarding for new developers
- Isolated modification of components
- Clear data flow tracking
- Sustainable long-term maintenance
